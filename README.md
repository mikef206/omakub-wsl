# Omakub-WSL

This is a cutdown version of Omakub for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Installation
- On your WSL terminal, run the following command:
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikef206/omakub-wsl/main/setup | bash
```

- If needed, setup VScode with this guide https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial  

Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
